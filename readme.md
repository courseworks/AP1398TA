### Topics

1. Github 
1. Docker
1. Basic C++ Review
   * Vectors
   *  **findMin() function**: Gets a vector and returns its minimum element.
   *  **findArgMin() function**: Gets a vector and return the index of its minimum elemnt.
   *  **findMinimum() function**: Gets a vector and gives its minimum element and its argmin together!
   *  **factorial() function**: Gets a number and returns its factorial in a simple way.
1. Recursive Algorithms
   *  **factorail1() function**: Gets a number and returns its factorial in a recursive way.
   *  **fibo() function**:  Gets number i and returns the i-th element of the fibonacci series in a recursive way
1. Dynamic Programming
   *  **fibo1() function**:  Gets number i and returns the i-th element of the fibonacci series. We used dynamic programming to compensate the simple recursive limits!
1. Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem
   * Finding the minimum scalar multiplications needed for multiplying a chain of n matrices with dynamic programming. You can refer to
[this](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Algorithms/MyAlgorithms/Dynamic/chainMatrixMult.htm) or the famous *CLRS algorithm book* for more information. We did this job with the **findMinOps() function**.
